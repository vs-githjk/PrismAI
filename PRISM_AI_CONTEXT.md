# PrismAI — LLM Handoff Document

> Written for an LLM picking up development. Read this before touching any code.

---

## Current State (as of Apr 20 2026) — Read First

**Last session focus:** Security hardening, reliability fixes, race condition patches (13 confirmed bugs fixed, pushed to main as commit `4c8877b`).

**Landing page is done.** Do not rework it unless the user explicitly asks. Current state the user signed off on:
- WebGL Prism (`ogl`) as full-page background — `glow=1.4`, `bloom=1.2`, `scale=3.6`, `baseWidth=5.5`, `colorFrequency=1.1`
- Two `LightPillar` (`three.js`) components in left/right edges, `intensity=0.7`, masked with gradient to dissolve toward center
- Top vignette + bottom fade gradient overlays
- Space Grotesk + Manrope fonts loaded
- `gradient-text` ("Clarity that lasts.") uses `filter: drop-shadow` (NOT `text-shadow` — doesn't work on clipped text)
- Glass panels at `rgba(7,4,15,0.68)` opacity

**Known visual note (left intentionally as-is):** `UpcomingMeetings.jsx` panel in the Join tab uses a lighter `rgba(255,255,255,0.015)` background vs the "NEXT UP" banner which uses `rgba(14,165,233,0.08)`. User saw this disparity and decided to leave it unchanged.

## What Is PrismAI

A meeting intelligence web app. User pastes a transcript, uploads audio, records live, or connects a bot to a live Zoom/Meet/Teams call. The transcript is routed to 7 parallel AI agents (LLaMA 3.3-70b via Groq) each producing a different output card. The name "Prism" is intentional — white light (raw transcript) enters the prism (orchestrator) and splits into 7 colors (agents).

**Live URLs:**
- Frontend: Vercel (`https://agentic-meeting-copilot.vercel.app/`)
- Backend: Render.com (`https://meeting-copilot-api.onrender.com`)
- GitHub: `https://github.com/vs-githjk/PrismAI` (repo was renamed — update your remote: `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/vs-githjk/PrismAI.git`)

> Note: The Render service is named `meeting-copilot-api` — this is the real URL. The display name in the Render dashboard was changed but the URL did not (Render locks URLs to creation-time name).

## The 7 Agents (ROYGBIV)

| Color | Agent | Runs | Output Key | Shape |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Red | `summarizer` | Always | `summary` | `string` |
| 🟠 Orange | `action_items` | Always | `action_items` | `[{ task, owner, due, completed }]` |
| 🟡 Yellow | `decisions` | Always | `decisions` | `[{ decision, owner, importance: 1-3 }]` |
| 🟢 Green | `sentiment` | Only if tension/conflict | `sentiment` | `{ overall, score, arc, notes, speakers:[{name,tone,score}], tension_moments:[] }` |
| 🔵 Blue | `email_drafter` | Always | `follow_up_email` | `{ subject, body }` |
| 🟣 Indigo | `calendar_suggester` | Only if follow-up discussed | `calendar_suggestion` | `{ recommended, reason, suggested_timeframe, resolved_date, resolved_day }` |
| 💜 Violet | `health_score` | Always | `health_score` | `{ score, verdict, badges:[], breakdown:{clarity,action_orientation,engagement} }` |

`calendar_suggestion` now includes `resolved_date` and `resolved_day` — resolved by `calendar_resolution.py` from the agent's natural language timeframe before returning to the frontend.

---

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | No | Liveness probe |
| POST | `/analyze` | No | Full analysis (non-streaming) |
| POST | `/analyze-stream` | No | SSE stream, one event per agent |
| POST | `/transcribe` | No | Whisper audio transcription |
| POST | `/agent` | No | Single agent re-run (used by chat intent) |
| POST | `/chat` | No | Chat with transcript context |
| POST | `/chat/global` | **Yes** | Chat across all user's saved meetings |
| GET | `/meetings` | **Yes** | List user's meetings |
| POST | `/meetings` | **Yes** | Save/upsert a meeting |
| PATCH | `/meetings/{id}` | **Yes** | Update result (action item checkboxes) |
| DELETE | `/meetings/{id}` | **Yes** | Delete meeting (cascades to chats) |
| GET | `/insights` | **Yes** | Cross-meeting intelligence (pure Python, no LLM) |
| GET | `/share/{token}` | No | Public read-only meeting by share token |
| GET | `/chats` | **Yes** | All chats as `{ meeting_id: messages[] }` map |
| GET | `/chats/{meeting_id}` | **Yes** | Single meeting's chat |
| POST | `/chats/{meeting_id}` | **Yes** | Save/upsert chat messages |
| DELETE | `/chats/{meeting_id}` | **Yes** | Delete chat |
| POST | `/join-meeting` | No | Start Recall.ai bot |
| GET | `/bot-status/{bot_id}` | No | Poll bot lifecycle + result |
| POST | `/recall-webhook` | No | Recall.ai event callbacks |
| POST | `/export/slack` | No | Send recap to Slack webhook |
| POST | `/export/notion` | No | Export full meeting to Notion |

**Auth pattern:** `require_user_id` in `auth.py` reads `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, validates against Supabase, returns `user_id`. All auth-gated endpoints scope their DB queries to that `user_id`. `/analyze`, `/chat`, `/agent` are intentionally unauthenticated so the demo flow works before sign-in.

---

## Supabase Schema

```sql
create table meetings (
  id bigint primary key,           -- Date.now()-based ID from frontend
  user_id uuid references auth.users(id),
  date text not null,
  title text,
  score int,
  transcript text,
  result jsonb,
  share_token text unique,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table chats (
  id bigserial primary key,
  meeting_id bigint references meetings(id) on delete cascade,
  user_id uuid references auth.users(id),
  messages jsonb not null default '[]',
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);

create index on meetings(user_id);
```

Both tables have `user_id`. All queries filter by it. `on delete cascade` means deleting a meeting automatically deletes its chat.

---

## Auth

- Frontend: `frontend/src/lib/supabase.js` initializes the Supabase client from `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` + `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. If either is missing, `supabase` exports as `null` and auth is disabled gracefully.
- Frontend: `frontend/src/lib/api.js` exports `apiFetch()` — always use this instead of raw `fetch()`. It auto-attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` from the active session.
- Frontend: `App.jsx` — `signInWithGoogle()` calls `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' })`. `authSession` / `authReady` states gate data loading. On sign-out, history and insights clear.
- **Local workspace on sign-in:** If a user has an unsaved analyzed meeting when they sign in, it is automatically saved to their account.
- Backend: `auth.py` — `require_user_id(request)` validates the Bearer token against Supabase's `/auth/v1/user` endpoint and returns `user_id`. Used as a FastAPI `Depends`.

---

## Streaming Analysis

Frontend calls `POST /analyze-stream`. Backend uses SSE + `asyncio.wait(FIRST_COMPLETED)` — each agent streams its result the moment it finishes. Frontend reads chunk by chunk, calling `setResult(prev => ({ ...prev, ...chunk }))`.

SSE event format:
```
data: {"agents_run": ["summarizer", "action_items", ...]}
data: {"agent": "summarizer", "summary": "..."}
data: {"agent": "action_items", "action_items": [...]}
data: [DONE]
```

`saveToHistory` is called on `[DONE]`. The stream has a 120s `AbortController` timeout.

---

## Cross-Meeting Intelligence

`GET /insights` (auth-gated) fetches the user's last 50 meetings and passes them to `cross_meeting_service.py`, which derives entirely in Python (no LLM call):

- **Top owners** — who has the most action items
- **Ownership drift** — owners carrying load across multiple meetings
- **Recurring themes** — significant terms appearing across meetings
- **Recurring blockers** — action items/summaries flagged with blocker language
- **Resurfacing decisions** — same decision topic appearing in multiple meetings
- **Hygiene issues** — meetings with missing owners or due dates
- **Recommended actions** — up to 4 concrete next steps based on the above

Shown in `CrossMeetingInsights.jsx` when signed in with 2+ meetings.

---

## Chat System

`ChatPanel.jsx` has three modes:

1. **Agent intent** — regex in `detectAgentIntent()`. Calls `POST /agent` with instruction. Updates the relevant result card. Single-level undo stores the previous value of that one key.
2. **Global intent** — regex in `detectGlobalIntent()`. Requires sign-in. Calls `POST /chat/global` which queries user's meeting history and answers across all meetings. Tagged with "⊕ searched all meetings".
3. **Regular chat** — `POST /chat` with message + transcript context.

**History dropdown:** Shows past meeting chats. "Viewing mode" shows a blue banner. Agent re-run intents are disabled in viewing mode.

---

## Recall.ai Bot Flow

1. `POST /join-meeting` → Recall.ai creates a bot, returns `bot_id`. Bot joins the call.
2. Frontend polls `GET /bot-status/{bot_id}` every 4 seconds.
3. When call ends, Recall.ai sends webhook to `POST /recall-webhook` → backend sets status to `processing`, fires `_process_bot_transcript` as a background task.
4. `_process_bot_transcript` fetches transcript from Recall (5 retries), runs `run_full_analysis`, stores result in `bot_store[bot_id]`.
5. Frontend poll sees `done` with transcript + result → saves to history, switches to results view.

**Critical:** `bot_store` is in-memory. Lost on Render restart. If Render restarts mid-meeting, the bot result is gone. This is a known limitation — fix requires moving to a `bots` Supabase table.

**Race condition fix (already applied):** Recall marks their bot `done` before our analysis finishes. The `/bot-status` endpoint guards against this by not letting Recall's `done` override our internal `processing` status until `_process_bot_transcript` actually completes.

---

## Auto-Deliver Recap

`deliverMeetingRecap()` in `App.jsx` fires automatically after a meeting is analyzed if Slack/Notion auto-send is enabled in integrations. Deduped by a `deliveryKey` to prevent double-sends. Configured via `IntegrationsModal.jsx` (settings saved to `localStorage`).

---

## Shareable Links

`share_token` (16-char hex) is generated at save time. Share button copies:
```
https://agentic-meeting-copilot.vercel.app/#share/{token}
```
On load, `App.jsx` checks `window.location.hash` for `#share/{token}`. Share links skip the landing and auth entirely. OG + Twitter meta tags injected dynamically for link previews.

---

## Landing Page

`LandingScreen` shown to first-time visitors only (gated by `sessionStorage`). Two CTAs:
- **"See it in action"** → fade-out → demo mode → auto-runs analysis on a random sample transcript
- **"Use my own transcript"** → fade-out → normal empty workspace

Share links bypass the landing. Logo in the header navigates back to the landing.

**Height-aware CSS breakpoints** in `index.css`: at `max-height: 1000px` the hero scales to 0.78, agent grid hides, headline shrinks. At `max-height: 800px` more aggressive compression. This covers standard laptop viewports.

### Landing Visual Layer (as of Apr 2026)

Three layered WebGL effects sit behind all landing content, stacked in DOM order (all `position:absolute, inset:0, pointer-events:none`):

1. **`<Prism />`** (`ogl`, `components/Prism.jsx`) — full-page ray-marched WebGL prism. `animationType="rotate"`, `scale=3.6`, `glow=1.4`, `bloom=1.2`, `colorFrequency=1.1`, `baseWidth=5.5`, `height=3.5`, `noise=0.04`. Transparent canvas — dark page bg shows through outside the prism shape.

2. **Top vignette** (`<div>`) — `linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(7,4,15,0.6) 0% → transparent 15%)` — keeps logo + badge readable.

3. **Bottom fade** (`<div>`) — `linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 60% → #07040f 100%)` — gives the prism a clean floor.

4. **`<LightPillar />`** × 2 (`three.js`, `components/LightPillar.jsx`) — one on each side edge (width 22%, full height). Both use `topColor="#38bdf8"`, `intensity=0.7`, `glowAmount=0.004`, `mixBlendMode="screen"`. Left: `bottomColor="#0d9488"`, `pillarRotation=30`. Right: `bottomColor="#6366f1"`, `pillarRotation=-30`. Both have inner-edge `mask-image` gradient so they dissolve toward the center.

**Tuning reference:**
- Prism too dim → raise `glow` / `bloom` (never go above ~2.0/1.6 or it washes out)
- Prism too wide/blurry → reduce `baseWidth`, raise `colorFrequency`
- Pillars too visible → lower `intensity` or tighten the mask gradient stop from 15% toward 5%
- Text unreadable → strengthen `text-shadow` on `.landing-screen h1/p` in `index.css` and/or deepen top vignette

**Fonts:** Space Grotesk (headings) + Manrope (body) loaded via Google Fonts in `index.html`. Declared in `index.css` as `--font-display` / `--font-body`.

**`gradient-text`** (used on "Clarity that lasts."): uses `background-clip: text` with a white→sky-blue gradient. Text-shadow doesn't work on clipped text — use `filter: drop-shadow()` instead.

---

## Environment Variables

| Var | Where | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Render | All LLM calls + Whisper |
| `RECALL_API_KEY` | Render | Recall.ai bot |
| `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` | Render | `https://meeting-copilot-api.onrender.com` |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Render | Supabase project URL |
| `SUPABASE_KEY` | Render | **service_role** key — never expose to frontend |
| `VITE_API_URL` | Vercel | Points frontend at backend |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Vercel | Same Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Vercel | **anon** key — safe for browser |

---

## Deployment

**Frontend:** Vercel auto-deploys from `main`. Root directory: `frontend`. Build: `npm run build`. Output: `dist`.

**Backend:** Render.com auto-deploys from `render.yaml` on push to `main`.
- Free tier spins down after inactivity → cold start 30-60s
- `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, `RECALL_API_KEY`, `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` must be set manually in Render dashboard

---

## Known Issues / Watch Out For

- **Render free tier sleeps** — first request after inactivity is slow. Not a bug.
- **`bot_store` is in-memory** — lost on Render restart. Syncs to `bot_sessions` via `_db_save`/`_db_load`; `/bot-status` falls back to DB on cache miss. Mostly solved.
- **Bot endpoints are unauthenticated** — `/join-meeting`, `/bot-status`, `/recall-webhook` have no auth. Bot results aren't scoped to a user. Known limitation of the current bot architecture.
- **Sentiment is conditional** — won't appear for neutral/positive meetings by design.
- **`decisions` importance** — 1 = critical, 2 = significant, 3 = minor. Sorted ascending in `DecisionsCard.jsx`.
- **SSE buffering** — `X-Accel-Buffering: no` header is set to mitigate Render free tier SSE buffering.
- **Meeting chat data structure** — `participant_events.chat_message` handler was fixed to read `data["data"]` but Recall.ai's payload shape may vary by platform (Google Meet vs Zoom vs Teams). If typed commands stop working, check Render logs for `[realtime] chat message` lines to verify the nesting. If blank, adjust the `outer.get("data") or outer.get("participant_events") or outer` fallback chain.
- **`gmail_send` needs explicit recipient** — LLM will not guess email addresses. User must say the full address in their command, e.g. "prism, send a follow-up to john@company.com".
- **`savedMeetingRef` on Render cold-start** — if the POST to `/meetings` fails (Render waking up), `savedMeetingRef` is now reset so retry is possible. Previously the guard stayed set and the meeting was silently lost.
- **Rate limiter uses `None` as user key** — `execute_tool()` in `tools/registry.py` tracks rate limits per `user_id`. Unauthenticated tool calls (from `/chat`) pass `user_id=None`, conflating all guest requests under one bucket. Not a security issue, minor fairness issue.
- **`RECALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`** — HMAC webhook verification is in place but only active if this env var is set on Render. Recall.ai dashboard has no static webhook endpoint configured (webhooks are registered per-bot in the API call body), so no signing secret is available yet. Verification is effectively skipped.

---

## Remaining Roadmap (priority order)

1. **Voice output verification** — the 415 fix (multipart upload) is deployed but needs a live meeting test to confirm. If `output_audio` still fails, check Render logs for the new error code.
2. **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` on Render** ✓ — already set. Model fallback is active.
3. **Gmail send UX** — user must state full recipient email in command. Future: parse names from transcript or show a confirmation UI before sending.
4. **Bot store persistence** — `bot_store` syncs to `bot_sessions` via `_db_save`/`_db_load`. `_db_load` is called as fallback in `/bot-status`. Mostly solved; verify the fallback path works in a live test.
5. **Team workspace** — add `workspace_id` to schema, invite flow, shared history. Blocked on single-user auth being stable first.

### Fixed Apr 20 2026 (commit 73e5097) — Two bugs from codebase audit

- **`get_valid_token()` `.single()` crash** — `calendar_routes.py:98` used `.single()` (throws PostgREST error on 0 rows) instead of `.maybe_single()`. Any chat tool call for a user without a connected calendar would return 500 instead of a clean 404 "not connected" error. Fixed: `.maybe_single()` + try-except.
- **`save_chat` TOCTOU race** — `storage_routes.py` used select+insert/update pattern (same race already fixed in `save_user_settings`). Two concurrent chat saves could both see an empty row and both insert, creating duplicate chat rows. Fixed: `upsert(on_conflict="meeting_id,user_id")`. Migration: `supabase/chats_unique_migration.sql` — run in Supabase SQL Editor before deploying.

### Fixed Apr 20 2026 (commit 33c5737) — Four follow-up bugs

- **`autoDeliveryRef` key collision** — `deliverMeetingRecap()` now takes `meetingId` as third arg; dedup key is the ID (not title+score), so two meetings with the same title/score both deliver correctly.
- **`savedMeetingRef` not reset on save failure** — `saveToHistory` `.catch()` now resets `savedMeetingRef.current = null` and `setMeetingId(null)`. If Render cold-starts and the POST fails, the user can retry.
- **Notion export silent truncation** — export now chunks all blocks into sequential `PATCH /blocks/{page_id}/children` calls (100 per request) after the initial page create. Large meetings no longer silently lose content past block 100.
- **`calendar_create_event` hardcoded `America/New_York`** — default timezone changed to `UTC`. LLM can still pass an explicit timezone if known; users outside ET no longer get wrong event times.

### Fixed Apr 20 2026 (commit 4c8877b) — Security hardening + reliability

**Security:**
- **CORS wildcard removed** — `main.py` now reads `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated). Default: Vercel URL + localhost. `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is set on Render.
- **`/transcribe` rate limited** — IP-based 5 req/min cap. Demo flow still works (no auth required), budget abuse blocked.
- **Recall webhook HMAC** — `recall_routes.py` verifies `x-recall-signature` if `RECALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set. Currently inactive (no static webhook registered in Recall dashboard — webhooks are per-bot). Safe to enable later.
- **Realtime tools bypass fixed** — `_process_command` now uses `get_available_tools(user_settings, exclude_confirm=True)`. Tools that require human confirmation (Gmail send, Slack post, Calendar create, Linear) are no longer offered to the live-meeting LLM. Defense-in-depth: even if LLM names one, `execute_tool` returns `requires_confirmation` instead of firing.
- **`/chat/confirm-tool` arg injection fixed** — server now stashes `{tool, arguments}` under a random `pending_id` (5-min TTL, `_pending_tools` dict in `chat_routes.py`). Client sends only `pending_id` at confirm time. Client can no longer swap args between preview and execution.

**Reliability:**
- **All 6 agents catch `Exception` not `JSONDecodeError`** — `summarizer`, `action_items`, `decisions`, `sentiment`, `email_drafter`, `calendar_suggester` now return safe defaults on any failure, not just parse errors. Matches `health_score.py`'s existing pattern.
- **`llm_call` fallback detection** — replaced `"429" in str(exc)` string matching with typed `exc.status_code` check + specific keyword list. More reliable; won't miss 500/502/504.
- **`strip_fences` edge case** — regex rewrite handles `` ```json{...}``` `` on a single line (old line-split code returned empty string → retry).

**Bugs:**
- **`ProactiveSuggestions` auth drop** — was using raw `fetch()`, dropping the auth token. Now uses `apiFetch`.
- **`save_user_settings` TOCTOU** — replaced select+insert/update with `upsert(on_conflict="user_id")`. Two tabs saving simultaneously no longer races.
- **`get_meetings` filter after limit** — now fetches 200 rows before filtering for meaningful results, then caps at 50. Partial saves no longer crowd out real meetings.
- **`_db_append_command` race** — replaced read-modify-write with atomic Postgres RPC (`append_bot_command`). SQL migration: `supabase/bot_commands_migration.sql` (already run ✓).
- **`RECALL_API_BASE` hardcoded** — both `recall_routes.py` and `realtime_routes.py` now read from `RECALL_API_BASE` env var (default: `us-west-2`).

**Performance:**
- **ChatPanel persistence debounced** — 800ms debounce on chat writes. Was firing a POST on every single message state change.

### Fixed later same session (Apr 19 2026)

**Realtime / live meeting:**
- **Double message bug** — `_send_voice_response` was falling back to `_send_chat_response` when voice failed, causing every response to appear twice. Removed the fallback — chat is always sent first (line 232), voice is additive only.
- **Voice 415 error** — `output_audio/` endpoint was receiving raw bytes with `Content-Type: audio/mpeg`. Recall.ai expects multipart form-data. Fixed: `files={"file": ("audio.mp3", audio_bytes, "audio/mpeg")}`.
- **Tool over-triggering** — LLM was calling `gmail_read` to answer "what's the day?". Two fixes: (1) injected current datetime into system prompt so factual questions need no tools, (2) tightened system prompt: only call a tool when the command explicitly requires external data.
- **Tool call format error (400)** — Llama 3.3 70b occasionally generates malformed tool calls. Added try/except in the Groq tool loop: on 400, strips `tools` from call_kwargs and retries plain.
- **`gmail_send` hallucinating `example.com`** — LLM was guessing recipient addresses. System prompt now: for `gmail_send`, only send if the user states a full email address in their command — otherwise ask for it.
- **Meeting chat commands silently ignored** — `participant_events.chat_message` handler was reading message text from the wrong nesting level (`payload["data"]` root instead of `payload["data"]["data"]`). Commands typed in Google Meet/Zoom chat were never processed. Fixed to mirror transcript event pattern. Added logging.

**History / auth:**
- **Workspace blank after demo exit** — `exitDemoMode` called `clearWorkspaceState` leaving an empty workspace. Now calls `loadFromHistory(history[0])` if signed in with history, restoring the last real meeting.
- **`savedMeetingRef` not set on auth auto-load** — when sign-in auto-loaded the latest meeting, `savedMeetingRef.current` stayed null, breaking the duplicate-save guard for subsequent actions. Now set on auto-load.
- **Share button missing for older meetings** — `shareToken` was null for meetings saved before the share_token field existed. Both auth auto-load and `loadFromHistory` now generate a token on demand and silently PATCH it to Supabase.
- **`PATCH /meetings/:id`** — extended to accept `share_token` in addition to `result`.

**UI:**
- **Transcript box truncated at 180 chars** — now `max-h-36 overflow-y-auto` with full transcript scrollable inside. `whitespace-pre-wrap` added so speaker line breaks render correctly.

**Agents:**
- **Summarizer length** — was hardcoded to 2-3 sentences regardless of transcript size. Now scales: <500 words → 2-3 sentences, 500-2000 words → short paragraph, 2000+ words → 3-5 sentences covering all major topics.

**Infrastructure / resilience:**
- **Model fallback** — all 7 agents now use `llm_call()` in `agents/utils.py` instead of calling Groq directly. On 429/503/overload, falls back to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set on Render. `anthropic>=0.40.0` added to `requirements.txt`.
- **Calendar status endpoint** — was making two Supabase queries and had dead/contradictory logic. Replaced with single query: `connected = calendar_connected AND google_access_token is set`.

### Previously fixed
- **Landing page visual overhaul (Apr 2026)** — replaced CSS-only prism center element with full-page WebGL Prism background (`ogl`). Added LightPillar corner effects (`three.js`). Loaded Space Grotesk + Manrope fonts. Tuned gradient overlays, glass panel opacity, gradient-text contrast, and `filter: drop-shadow` for clipped text.
- **CrossMeetingInsights 3-col header overflow** — OWNERSHIP DRIFT / ACTION HYGIENE / UNRESOLVED DECISIONS labels clipped by `overflow-hidden` container on narrow viewports. Headers now stack vertically.
- **Decision theme noise** — Month/day names (`april`, `monday`, `jan`, etc.) were surfacing as recurring decision themes. Full set of month/day names + abbreviations added to `STOP_WORDS` in `CrossMeetingInsights.jsx`.
- **Aria-labels** — send message (ChatPanel), delete chat session (ChatPanel), remove speaker (App.jsx).

## Agent Code Pattern

`strip_fences` is in `backend/agents/utils.py`. Import it, don't redefine it:

```python
import json, os
from groq import AsyncGroq
from fastapi import HTTPException
from .utils import strip_fences

client = AsyncGroq(api_key=os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY"))

SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    "You are a ___. ..."
    'Return ONLY valid JSON: { "key": ... }. '
    "If the transcript contains a [User instruction: ...] line, follow it exactly."
)

async def run(transcript: str) -> dict:
    for attempt in range(2):
        response = await client.chat.completions.create(
            model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
            temperature=0.3,
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"Transcript:\n{transcript}"},
            ],
        )
        raw = response.choices[0].message.content
        try:
            return json.loads(strip_fences(raw))
        except Exception:
            if attempt == 1:
                return _DEFAULT  # never raise — streaming run must not be killed by one agent
    return _DEFAULT
```

### Adding a New Agent — Checklist

1. Create `backend/agents/yourname.py` — follow the pattern above
2. Import it in `backend/analysis_service.py`
3. Add to `AGENT_MAP` and `AGENT_RESULT_KEY` in `analysis_service.py`
4. Add default value to `DEFAULT_RESULT` in `analysis_service.py` (and mirror in `frontend/src/App.jsx`)
5. Add to both result-builder loops in `analysis_routes.py`
6. Add to `ALL_AGENTS` list in `orchestrator.py`
7. Add guardrail in `orchestrator.py` if it should always run
8. Add to `AGENTS_META` in `App.jsx` with icon + gradient
9. Add to `AGENT_CONFIG` in `AgentTags.jsx` with ROYGBIV color
10. Create `YournameCard.jsx` in `frontend/src/components/`
11. Import and place card in `App.jsx` (both desktop and mobile layouts)

## Google Calendar Integration (fully working ✓)

### What was built
- `backend/calendar_routes.py` — `POST /calendar/connect`, `POST /calendar/exchange-code`, `GET /calendar/events`, `GET /calendar/status`, `DELETE /calendar/disconnect`
- `supabase/calendar_migration.sql` — `user_settings` table (**already run**)
- `frontend/src/components/UpcomingMeetings.jsx` — panel in Join tab showing upcoming events with meeting links; star/mark events for auto-join
- `IntegrationsModal.jsx` — Calendar tab with connect/disconnect UI and auto-join mode selector
- `App.jsx` — `calendarConnected` state, `connectGoogleCalendar()`, `disconnectCalendar()`, auto-join polling effect, auto-join prompt toast

### Auto-join modes (stored in `localStorage` as `prism_autojoin`)
- `off` (default) — nothing automatic
- `ask` — toast prompt when meeting starts within 5 min
- `auto` — bot joins automatically at ≤2 min
- `marked` — auto-join only starred events (stars stored in `localStorage` as `prism_marked_events`)

### Workspace declutter (done)
- Removed hero blurb card (eyebrow, H1, 4 status pills)
- Removed "Input Quality" nested box (duplicate stats + patronizing copy)
- Replaced with a single slim `Meeting workspace` header

### Calendar connect — WORKING

**Root cause (resolved):** Supabase v2 does not persist `provider_token` in stored sessions. Three Supabase-based approaches were tried; all failed.

**Fix:** Direct Google OAuth PKCE flow, completely bypassing Supabase for the calendar token.

**How it works:**
1. `connectGoogleCalendar()` generates a PKCE verifier/challenge, stores verifier in `sessionStorage`, redirects to Google OAuth with `state=calendar_connect`
2. Google redirects back to `window.location.origin` with `?code=...&state=calendar_connect`
3. A `useEffect` in `App.jsx` detects `state === 'calendar_connect'`, retrieves the verifier, cleans the URL, POSTs to `/calendar/exchange-code`
4. Backend exchanges the code+verifier with Google, stores tokens in `user_settings`, returns `{ok: true}`
5. Frontend sets `calendarConnected = true`

**Env vars in place:**
- Vercel: `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- Render: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Google Cloud Console: redirect URIs `https://agentic-meeting-copilot.vercel.app` and `http://localhost:5173` added

**Files involved:**
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` — `generateCodeVerifier`, `generateCodeChallenge`, `connectGoogleCalendar` (PKCE flow), calendar callback `useEffect`
- `frontend/src/components/IntegrationsModal.jsx` — Calendar tab UI
- `frontend/src/components/UpcomingMeetings.jsx` — events panel
- `backend/calendar_routes.py` — `POST /calendar/exchange-code` (PKCE token exchange), all other calendar routes
- `supabase/calendar_migration.sql` — already applied

## Live Meeting Tools + Voice — Setup Checklist

The agentic tool-calling system and live voice responses require several env vars and external service configs. Here's everything needed:

### Render Dashboard — Environment Variables

Add these in Render → `meeting-copilot-api` → Environment:

| Variable | Required? | Where to get it | What it enables |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | **Yes** | [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) | All LLM calls + Whisper transcription |
| `RECALL_API_KEY` | **Yes** | [recall.ai dashboard](https://recall.ai) | Bot joining meetings |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | **Yes** | Supabase → Settings → API | Database + auth |
| `SUPABASE_KEY` | **Yes** | Supabase → Settings → API → `service_role` key | Backend DB access (never expose to frontend) |
| `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` | **Yes** | Already set: `https://meeting-copilot-api.onrender.com` | Recall.ai webhooks |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | **Yes** | Google Cloud Console → Credentials | Calendar/Gmail OAuth |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | **Yes** | Google Cloud Console → Credentials | Calendar/Gmail token exchange |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | For voice | [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io) → Profile → API Keys | TTS voice responses in meetings |
| `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` | Optional | ElevenLabs → Voices → copy ID | Custom voice (default: `21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM` / Rachel) |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | For Slack | Slack App → OAuth & Permissions → Bot Token (`xoxb-...`) | Slack read/post/search tools |
| `LINEAR_API_KEY` | For Linear | [linear.app/settings/api](https://linear.app/settings/api) | Linear issue creation tool |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | **Yes** | `https://agentic-meeting-copilot.vercel.app,http://localhost:5173` | CORS allowlist — already set ✓ |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | **Yes** | console.anthropic.com | LLM fallback on Groq 429/503 — already set ✓ |
| `RECALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Optional | Recall.ai dashboard → Webhooks → signing secret | HMAC webhook verification (not yet available — webhooks are per-bot) |
| `RECALL_API_BASE` | Optional | Default: `https://us-west-2.recall.ai/api/v1` | Override Recall region if needed |

### Vercel Dashboard — Environment Variables

Add these in Vercel → Project Settings → Environment Variables:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` | `https://meeting-copilot-api.onrender.com` |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase `anon` key (safe for browser) |
| `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Same Google Client ID as Render |

### Google Cloud Console — Required Setup

1. **OAuth Consent Screen** → Edit → Scopes → Add:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`
2. **Credentials** → Your OAuth 2.0 Client → Authorized redirect URIs:
   - `https://agentic-meeting-copilot.vercel.app`
   - `http://localhost:5173` (for local dev)
3. If the app is in "Testing" mode, add your Google account as a test user

### Supabase — Migrations

Run in **Supabase SQL Editor** (in order, skip if already applied):

1. `supabase/auth_migration.sql` — creates `meetings` + `chats` tables
2. `supabase/calendar_migration.sql` — creates `user_settings` table with Google token columns
3. `supabase/tools_migration.sql` — adds `linear_api_key`, `slack_bot_token` columns + creates `bot_sessions` table
4. `supabase/bot_commands_migration.sql` — creates `append_bot_command(p_bot_id, p_command)` RPC for atomic command appends (**already run ✓ Apr 20 2026**)

### What works without optional env vars

| Missing var | Impact |
|---|---|
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | Bot still works — responds via **meeting chat text** instead of voice. TTS silently falls back to chat. |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Slack tools unavailable in chat. Users can still set per-user tokens via Integrations modal. |
| `LINEAR_API_KEY` | Linear tool unavailable. Users can still set per-user keys via Integrations modal. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` | Calendar connect + Gmail tools disabled entirely. |

### How live meeting commands work (end to end)

1. User clicks "Join Meeting" → `POST /join-meeting` creates Recall.ai bot with `realtime_endpoints` webhook
2. Recall.ai streams transcript chunks + chat messages to `POST /realtime-events` in real time
3. `realtime_routes.py` watches for trigger phrase: **"Prism, ..."** or **"PrismAI, ..."**
4. Detected command → LLM (Groq) picks tools from the user's available set → executes
5. Response sent back via:
   - Meeting chat: `POST /bot/{id}/send_chat_message/` (always works)
   - Voice (if ElevenLabs configured): ElevenLabs TTS → `POST /bot/{id}/output_audio/`
6. Command logged to `bot_sessions` table + shown in frontend command log
7. After meeting ends → full transcript analysis runs as before (7 agents)
